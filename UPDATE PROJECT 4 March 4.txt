Updated Clock Divisor
1. Changed wrap around, to set to data value at 1 so it stays in cycle with other components. Not sure if this is how the clock divisor is supposed to work yet, but made sure its in sync.
2. Used MUX to select which clock value is outputed based on Baud Rate Divisor.

Updated SECDED

USED 2 spliters and combinational logic to make SECDED ENCODING FROM 16bit to 22bit.
